It provides a platform to build essential career skills and gain valuable experience.

## Introduction ðŸš€

At Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a fantastic organization focused on bikes & cycling accessories, we collaborated with Tony Smith (Partner) from KPMGâ€™s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. The project primarily involved three exciting tasks:

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment ðŸ“Š

Our first mission was to assess the quality and completeness of the provided datasets in preparation for the analysis. The datasets included:

* Customer Demographic 
* Customer Addresses
* Customer List
* Transactions data from the past 3 months

We dove into the world of data wrangling and exploration to identify ways to enhance the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltdâ€™s data.

## Task 2: Data Insights ðŸŽ¯

In this task, we aimed to target high-value customers based on customer demographics and attributes. We started by outlining our approach in a captivating PowerPoint presentation. The project spanned over three weeks, consisting of the following phases - Data Exploration; Model Development, and Interpretation.

We carefully planned the analysis approach, covering activities like understanding data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, and result interpretation.

## Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation ðŸ“ˆ

Visualizing data to present insights is a powerful way to convey valuable information. To accomplish this, we utilized Tableau to develop an engaging dashboard that showcases the data summary and analysis results. During the presentation, we focused on essential business contexts, such as:

* Identifying trends in the underlying data
* Determining the customer segment with the highest customer value
* Proposing effective marketing and growth strategies for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd
* Exploring additional external datasets to gain deeper insights into customer preferences and purchase behavior.
